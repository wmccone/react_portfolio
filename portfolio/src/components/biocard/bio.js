            Bootcamp at the University of Texas.
            I have 10+ years in the SaaS industry with 8 of those years in recruiting software.

            I currently work for a Company called CareerPlug. CareerPlugâ€™s innovative hiring solutions help over
            10,000 companies attract, evaluate and retain high-quality team members. CareerPlug provides
            recruiting software to help small, medium and franchise businesses hire top talent.

            While I am currently a Sales person at CareerPlug, I look forward to growing my skillsets in the
            software industry as I learn to code. I hope that one day I will be able to code full time.
